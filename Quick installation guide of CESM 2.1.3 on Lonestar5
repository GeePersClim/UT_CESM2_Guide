# 
#   STEP 1: Download CESM 2.1.3 github repository from Earth System Community Modeling Portal to the directory /my_cesm_sandbox/
#

git clone -b release-cesm2.1.3 https://github.com/ESCOMP/CESM.git my_cesm_sandbox

# 
#   STEP 2: Get into the directory /my_cesm_sandbox/
#

cd my_cesm_sandbox

# 
#   STEP 3: Checkout externals
#

./manage_externals/checkout_externals
